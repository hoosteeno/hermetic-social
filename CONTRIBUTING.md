## Sending Pull Requests

Patches should be submitted as pull requests. When submitting patches as PRs:

- You agree to license your code under the project's open source license (MPL 2.0).
- Base your branch off the current master (see below for an example workflow).
- Add both your code and new tests if relevant.
- Run npm test to make sure all tests still pass.
- Please do not include merge commits in pull requests; include only commits with the new relevant code.

See the main [README](./README.md) for information on prerequisites, installing, running and testing.
